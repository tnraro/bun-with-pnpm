# bun-with-pnpm

This simple Docker image can resolve several annoying issues with Bun.

- It replaces Bun's immature package manager with pnpm.
- It provides an easy workaround for dependency issues that require Node, which Bun doesn't fully support yet.

Well, in the long run, it might be better to reduce reliance on Bun. While I've been a long-time user of Bun and will continue to use it, I don't plan to use it for production apps.
